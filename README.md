# Recurrent Neural Network for time series forecasting

A recurrent neural network-based model for time series prediction.

*Note: This chart includes the training, validation, and testing data. To obtain reliable statistics, the model must be evaluated in the final testing phase (from 2019 onwards), which are the data that the model has never encountered before.*

⚠️Disclaimer: Optimum select and best combination algorithms may introduce overfitting. If you use it, be sure to implement a system to correct for selection bias, overfitting, and non-normality to ensure model robustness.
This is example code for educational purposes. Under no circumstances put these models into production because the probability of losing money is too high.⚠️
